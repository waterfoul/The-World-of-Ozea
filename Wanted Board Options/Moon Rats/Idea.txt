That the giant rats are moon rats.
Whether it's because he's too lazy or too busy, he'd rather pay some adventurers some gold to go downstairs into the tavern cellar and deal with the giant rats that have been making a mess around his ale barrels and food stores.
The PCs descend down a ladder, and into a humid cellar that is split into two rooms, separated by a hardwood door.
No rats in the first half. But when the PCs open the door into the wine cellar, behind which is located the meat locker behind a second door, pairs of gleaming eyes reflect out of the darkness and towards the room the PCs are standing in. Only a single shaft of moonlight coming through a grate lights the basement (and none of the rats are standing in it).
Battle. 8 giant rats vs PCs.
When the PCs examine the second room, they hear loud, violent bangs on the door to the meat locker. Upon inspection, they find a dire rat trying to break in and get the meat. The dire rat would run towards the PCs to attack, but as soon as it crosses through the shaft of moonlight, it stops and stands upright, pruning its whiskers with its arms.
"Please help, we are starving," the rat says.
If the PCs decide to converse with the rat, he'll introduce himself by name, and describe how he leads a large family of moonrats that were displaced by larger beasts in the forest, and had to invade the tavern cellar to find food, but when they entered the basement, they lost the moonlight, and went feral. "You ... killed them?" he'll say with watery eyes. He is the strongest and smartest of the moonrats, in both intelligent and feral forms, so his death would likely cause the younger rats to die.
The PCs are faced with a choice. All of a sudden, they aren't killing mindless rats, they've murdered intelligent beings who are in desperate need of help. Do they inform the tavern keeper? Do they kill the rat?
